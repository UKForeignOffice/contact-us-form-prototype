# Contact Us Form Prototype

## Background

As part of the email triage/handling project, we're looking at improving the front-end user experience when they get in touch with us by directing them to appropriate GOV.UK resources when they submit an enquiry rather than them getting in touch with us and having to wait for us to point them in the right direction. 

## About the prototype

The prototype offers different variants of journeys for users, including search suggestions and intercepts for key subjects
